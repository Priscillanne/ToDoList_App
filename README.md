#Kanbarn Review

We used GitHub Projects to create a Kanban board after completing the main development iterations. The board was structured with columns for Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Testing, and Done. Instead of planning tasks in advance, we mainly used the board to organize and track completed tasks from each iteration to ensure everything was implemented correctly.

Some challenges we faced included forgetting to update the board during development, which made it less useful for real-time task tracking. Since most tasks were added after development, the board didn’t help much with planning or collaboration during coding.

However, it was still useful for reviewing our progress. By organizing tasks into columns, we could visually confirm which features were completed and whether they matched the goals of each iteration. This made it easier to cross-check our code against planned tasks, identify anything we missed, and get a clear overview of the project’s overall progress.
