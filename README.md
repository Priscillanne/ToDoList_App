Iteration 2: report 
In this second iteration, the To-Do-List application was significantly upgraded to include 

1. Due date
2. Priority 
3. Category for each task. 

These additions helps users better organize and manage their task by allowing them to set deadlines, assign importance and group tasks by context, moreover input validation was added to ensure users enter dates in the correct yyyy-mm-dd format and select only valid priority levels (High, Medium, Low).

All existing features such as 
1. Adding
2. Viewing
3. Deleting 
4. Updating 
5. Filtering tasks 

These features were adapted to support and display the new fields. The view functions now provide a richer and more informative output which improves the overall user experience not only that but status filtering also reflects these changes like showing tasks along with their new details when filtered.
