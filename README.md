**Iteration 1: report **

The first iteration of the To-Do-List application is a basic command-line interface which was developed using python, in the application allows users to: 

1. Add tasks
2. View all tasks
3. Delete tasks 
4. Mark tasks as done 
5. Filter tasks based on their status

Each task is stored as a dictionary containing two fields whose name and status are set to “pending” upon creation. The menu-driven interface guides the user through each operation which ensures a smooth interaction experience.
