## 1.0 Introduction to the Application

This assignment is a To-Do-List Application developed for the **Software Engineering course (BAI21113), Assignment 1**. This is a Python based application designed  to help users effectively manage their daily tasks. 

## The app allows users to:  
1. Add new task
2. View all tasks
3. Delete task
4. Mark Task as completed 
5. View Done/Pending Tasks
6. Categorize task
7. Prioritize task 
8. Set due dates for each task

The main goal of this application is to improve personal productivity by providing a simple yet efficient task management system, which enables users to track their responsibilities  and stay organized. 

This assignment  involves three structured iterations each adding new functionality and a user friendly graphical interface (GUI). 

## 1.1 Technologies Used
### 1.1.0 Development Tools & Process
