# Iteration 3
In this third iteration, the To-Do-List application transitioned from a console-based interface to a fully functional Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Tkinter. This marks a significant usability improvement, making the app more user-friendly and visually accessible.

* **All major task operations such as:**
- Adding
- Deleting
- Updating
- Filtering tasks - are now done through interactive dialog boxes and buttons, replacing terminal inputs.

* **Moreover, each task retains the previous attributes:**
- Name
- Status
- Due date
- Priority
- Category - for consistency, and tasks are displayed with clear formatting inside a scrollable window.
